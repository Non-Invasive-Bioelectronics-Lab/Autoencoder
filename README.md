Autoencoder Deep Learning model for EEG artifact removal in Android smartphone

This Android Studio project contains the Deep Autoencoder model for single-channel EEG artifact removal in Android smartphone, some details are here:
* The Android studio version used for this work is: Android Studio Dolphin | 2021.3.1 Patch 1;
* To enable the hardware acceleration for faster computing in smartphones, Tensorflow Lite 2.11.0 was used, and the latest version should also work;
